FEATURES:
* Added a new menu to access all inventory locations from
	a centeral location without the need to memorize all slash commands.
* The command to open this menu is /imhobags menu
	Put the command into a macro to have a convenient menu
	popup whenever you click the macro button.
* The items in each group can now be sorted either by name, icon or rarity.
	Sorting items by icon may result in items of similar type to be arranged
	together, for example all cloth items followed by all wood, followed
	by all herbs and so on. I suggest experimenting which sort option suites
	you best.
* Hovering your mouse over a money display in a item window shows
	a summary of all the money you have on the current shard.
CHANGES:
* Mounts and Pets are now grouped under collectibles like artifacts.
FIXES:
* Some tweaks to update performance. Further improvements are still underway.
ISSUES:
* The mail database is cleared everytime the Trion mail window is opened.
* Item tooltips may show up in the top-left corner of the screen.
* Some items may not show up in the item windows due to broken values in the API.
