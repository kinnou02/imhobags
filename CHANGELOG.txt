FEATURES:
* Items are now stored for all accounts.
* Some item locations now support multiple types of views:
	- default: This is the way you know it with items grouped by AH category.
	- bags: Group items by the bag they are located in isntead of AH category.
	- onebag: No item grouping whatsoever, all items in a single group.
* You can now sort your items by the bag slot they are placed in.
* It is now possible to show the empty slots as concrete items in the bag
	windows by clicking the empty item count in the top right corner.
* Setting your layout to "onebag", the sorting to "slot" and showing
	empty items gives you the same view as known from "all-in-one" addons.
