FEATURES:
* Added a new menu to access all inventory locations from
	a centeral location without the need to memorize all slash commands.
* The command to open this menu is /imhobags menu
	Put the command into a macro to have a convenient menu
	popup whenever you click the macro button.
* The items in each group can now be sorted either by name, icon or rarity.
	Sorting items by icon may result in items of similar type to be arranged
	together, for example all cloth items followed by all wood, followed
	by all herbs and so on. I suggest experimenting which sort option suites
	you best.
