0.20beta1 (February 2014)
---------
FEATURES:
* When sorting by rarity, if the items are "rare" or better AND are armor or weapons,
  then the items will be first grouped/sorted by equip. location.  (In other words,
  all "helms" will be together, etc.)



0.20beta (February 2014)
---------
FEATURES:
* Dream Weaving items now have their own category
FIXES:
* Transcendent item buttons should now have the proper "red" outline 
* Fixed "Error: performance warning" (ImhoBags/ItemHandler.lua: in function 'Drag')
NOTES:
* I have confirmed that the Rift addon API has a bug that is causing stackable items in
  bank vaults not to update properly in the imhobags window.  I've reported this directly
  to Zorba (the addon dev) and hopefully he'll have a chance to fix it in the near future.
  

0.19beta2 (February 2014)
---------
FIXES:
* Fixed a bug that was causing items not to appear when viewing the equipment window for
  stored characters.


0.19beta (February 2014)
---------
FEATURES
* When sorting by 'rarity' the items with the same 'bind' and 'rarity' will then be sorted by name.
* Added new configuration option in the config window under 'extras':  "This setting allows you to 
  select the number of seconds the addon waits (after an inventory change) before updating the window.  
  When this value is greater than zero, the addon will update immediately on the first inventory change 
  and then will not update again until # seconds has elapsed without any other inventory changes.   
  (This setting is especially useful for players who move large amounts of items from one window to 
  another and are frustrated by categories shifting between moves.)"   This is an advanced setting
  and the default value is 0.
* Added ability to customize the sort order of categories within the inventory windows (currently,
  categories are sorted alphabetically.)   To utilize this feature, go to the configuration window,
  click the 'behaivor' button, and then click the 'category sort' window photo.   For a demonstration,
  please see http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=GTL-E9hprGE&vq=hd1080
FIXES:
* Leatherworking materials (hides, bones, leather, etc.) should now once again be sorted into 
  their own category.
* Fixed a number of reported errors (primarily attempts at indexing nil or non-table variables)
* Fix for several 'performance warning' errors.


0.18beta (January 2014)
---------
FEATURES
* When sorting items by "rarity", items will now sort first by rarity, then by 'bind' type, with
  "bind on pickup" items first, then items that are "bind to account", followed by "bind on equip" 
  items, and finally the rest.
FIXES:
* The SearchWindow will now open in the center of the screen on first use.  It will also properly
  save its location for future use when the window is closed or you logout/exit game/reloadui.
* Fix for "attempt to call method ''MoveToGrid'' (a nil value)" error.  It appears that the code
  intended to reduce performance warnings was not 100% successful.  "Performance warning" errors
  should still be greatly reduced when NOT in combat.  However, fixes for performance warning errors
  while in combat (i.e., when the system is "secure") is forthcoming.
* Added code to reduce 'performance warning' errors when opening the Configuration Window.


0.17beta (December 2013)
---------
FEATURES:
* Added handling for the "performance warning" errors that some users may have
  experienced.  The methodology used will cause the imhothar bags animation
  used to look a bit different when in combat (this is an addon API limitation.)
  However, there is no functionality changes whatsoever with this feature.
* The search box in the title bar will now search in the same way that the 
  "search database" window has always worked: case-insensitive by item name.
* Item enchantments such as runes, whetstones, and insoles now have their
  own category.
FIXES:
* Fixed Guild Vault labels when sorting by 'bags'
* Fixed a bug in which moving multiple stacks of items that have a "quantity"
  might result in buttons not working (especially if the first stacks moved
  were of lesser quantity.)
* Fixed a bug in which using the in-game "auto-sort bags" feature might result
  in buttons not working properly.


0.16beta2 (December 2013)
---------
FEATURES:
* General updates for RIFT 2.5 compatibility (Big thanks to Ivnedar for his expertise!)
CHANGES:
* The Addon will update the internal item storage database if ItemStorage.version < 0.16
  (In other words, the addon should reset the "SavedVariables" file for you when upgrading
   to this version.)  If you have a lot of bank vaults, you may get a "performance warning"
   the first time you open your full bank.  This shouldn't happen again until the internal
   item storage database requires another update.   Please note that this update may reset
   your window positions/configuration, sort options, etc.
FIXES:
* Fixed a typo involving "transcendant" items
* Fixed items currently placed in bank vault slots (caused by addon API changes in RIFT 2.4)
* Fixed the Texture:SetTexture() "Incorrect function usage" bug
* Fixed the display of bank vaults when grouped by 'bags'


0.15beta (June 2013)
--------
FEATURES:
* Requires RIFT 2.3
* New translations for Russian
* New translations for Simplified and Traditional Chinese
CHANGES:
* The "autoOpen" configuration option is now enabled by default
FIXES:
* "player" is now an accepted as character name in the slash command
* Fixed credit-related errors in 2.3
* Fixed scrollbar errors in the configuration window
* Fixed an error related to guild items
* Adjusted the empty slot indicator for the new 2.3 bags bar
