0.16beta3
FIXES:
* Fixed Guild Vault labels when sorting by 'bags'



0.16beta2 (December 2013)

FEATURES:
* General updates for RIFT 2.5 compatibility (Big thanks to Ivnedar for his expertise!)
CHANGES:
* The Addon will update the internal item storage database if ItemStorage.version < 0.16
  (In other words, the addon should reset the "SavedVariables" file for you when upgrading
   to this version.)  If you have a lot of bank vaults, you may get a "performance warning"
   the first time you open your full bank.  This shouldn't happen again until the internal
   item storage database requires another update.   Please note that this update may reset
   your window positions/configuration, sort options, etc.
FIXES:
* Fixed a typo involving "transcendant" items
* Fixed items currently placed in bank vault slots (caused by addon API changes in RIFT 2.4)
* Fixed the Texture:SetTexture() "Incorrect function usage" bug
* Fixed the display of bank vaults when grouped by 'bags'
